Hi! My name is Jinlong Ru. I am a postdoctoral researcher at Technische Universität München (TUM) and Helmholtz Zentrum München (HMGU). My research focuses on the intersection of natural product drug discovery, phage therapy, and metagenomics. Currently, I am exploring the use of advanced viromics to identify novel bacteriophages, which holds promise in combating microbial infections. My work also involves developing tools for efficient viromics data analysis, aimed at enhancing our understanding of phage-host dynamics and facilitating new therapeutic discoveries.
